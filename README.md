### Learning Journal

This learning journal started as a way for me to keep track of what I learn, as I dive deeper into different aspects of programming. 

I use it to keep track of the reasons I make the choices I make in my current projects, in a more central place than what's provided by commit messages & project readme docs. Entries currently appear chronologically with no overarching organization except what I happen to be working on from day to day.
